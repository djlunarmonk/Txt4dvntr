First C# programming course assignment.

It's easy to get tired of my dad jokes. It's easy to get lost (rage-quitting is allowed), so shortly after the first "release" I added a tool to help you keep track of whether you already "was here" before or just letting off some of the profanity that may be building up inside.

If you build this from the commandline, you may need to manually move the map-file to running directory get the game running. At least one (of few) users using mac has reported this problem.
