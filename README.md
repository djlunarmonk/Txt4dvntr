First C# programming course assignment.

It's easy to get tired of my dad jokes. It's easy to get lost (rage-quitting is allowed), so shortly after the first "release" I added a tool to help you keep track of whether you already "was here" before or just letting off some of the profanity that may be building up inside. You can't save the current state of the game, so when sunday dinner is on the table (or needs to get there) you have to leave it running just like in the old days.

If you build this from the commandline, you may need to manually move the map-file to running directory get the game running. At least one (of few) users using mac has reported this problem.
